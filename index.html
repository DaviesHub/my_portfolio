    <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Davies Agommuoh is an aspiring fullstack software engineer who is currently a Chemical Engineering research

            African, he is aware of Africa's slumber in the technological stratosphere and is keen on working with 
            other engineers to contribute to the continent's output in software development.
