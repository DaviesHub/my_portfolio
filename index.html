        <strong>Guessing game</strong>: In this game, 'communist regimes' are randomly placed in a virtual 7x7 grid<br>
        and the player is supposed to guess the coordinates of the communist regimes. A communist regime is overthrown<br>
        when the coordinates of the cells it occupies are successful guessed. The goal is to overthrow the communist<br> 
        regimes with the fewest number of guesses possible.
